## CNV Autism project
Correlation study of the Vineland, ADOS, Mullen scores with the global copy number burden for Autistic and control individuals.
*	Analyzed global copy number burden for pathogenic events
*	Performed correlation analysis of the cohort with previously published environmental data
### Biofilter: A knowledge-integration system for Annotation and Model development of genomic data 									   
*	Developed methods for annotation of genomic regions, such as, CNVs
*	Integrated public databases into a meta-database, Library of Knowledge Integration
### ChIP-exo data analysis 								    
*	Developed a pipeline for detection of overlap between CTCF-binding motif locations with the peak co-ordinates determined by Genetrack software using Python and BedTools.

### Determining the sequence of the Y chromosome from whole genome alignment 
*	Performed quality check for the Illumina reads of the human Korean genome AK1.
*	Simulated short-reads of the male genome using wgsim in SamTools.
*	Aligned the human genome (hg18) against the male genome using Bowtie.
*	Assembled the unaligned reads using Velvet.
*	Aligned the assembled reads against the Y chromosome using LASTZ to check for coverage of the Y chromosome that could be retrieved.
### Study of genetic diversity and population structure of the endangered marsupial Sarcophilus harrisii (Tasmanian devil)                                     
*	Aligned cDNA sequences of Monodelphis to the Tasmanian devil’s genome using LASTZ.
*	Filtered low-complexity alignment results and false positive overlapping alignments.
*	Mapped SNP positions to aligned devil’s genome sequences.

George Mason University, VA                                                                    Aug 2008 – Dec 2009
Graduate Assistant
### SVM based approach for analyzing PPI’s of Treponema pallidum
*	Prepared training and test data from high confidence interaction and experimental data
*	Extracted attributes as k-mers, hydropathy, aminoacid content, jaccard coefficient
*	Generated prediction method based on kernel based classifier
*	Evaluated performance of model using Weka and SVM light
### A benchmark study of de-novo short-read assemblers 
*	Analyzed the performance of de-novo short-read assemblers such as Velvet, SSAKE, EDENA, VCAKE, ABySS, using ABI SOLiD data from the genome sequence of Adenovirus type 22
Topology prediction Project
*	   Predicted topology of Transmembrane alpha-helix of protein through Hidden Markov Models
*	   Prepared a script in python and used Viterbi algorithm approach 
Human Genome Database Project 						    
*	   Prepared a database with a user-friendly web-interface for information of human genes
*	   Used Perl, MySQL and HTML, and displayed the results via the web-interface
Bioinformatics Project/Dissertation                                                      Jan 2007 – June 2008
IBI Biosolutions, Chandigarh, India
*	Assisted private bioinformatics company with drug designing and restriction enzyme database
*	Developed a drug through In Silico Drug designing technique for Botulinum Neurotoxin of Clostridium botulinum 
*	Collaborated with software developers and created a database of restriction enzymes using PERL and PHP
Cloning Project                                                                                       June 2006 – July 2006
National Botanical Research Institute, Lucknow, India 2006
*	Cloned partial fragment of Mango cellulose gene and analyzed its expression patterns for a National Institute to identify and catalog degrees of Mango ripeness
*	Learned RNA extraction techniques and extracted RNA from mango leaves and fruit
Cytotoxicity assessment Project                                                          June 2005 – July 2005
Industrial Toxicology Research Centre, Lucknow, India 
*	Acquired knowledge of basic tools and techniques used in animal cell and tissue culture
*	Learned operation of various software guided tools for biochemical and molecular studies related to in vitro toxicology
Assessed the cytotoxic potential profile of rotenone, a pyrethroid pesticide in L929 cells
