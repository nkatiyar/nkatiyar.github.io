  {% include person.html image="images/robert.jpg" name="Robert Gramer" title="Medical Student Researcher" desc="Bobby is a third year medical student currently pursuing a Master's in Clinical Research through Duke's Clinical Research Training Program as a Rauch and DTMI scholar. Bobby ultimately intends to lead an academic career in functional neurosurgery, entrenched in collaboration with myriad other disciplines. By working with neuroscientists, neurologists, engineers, and programmers he hopes to push the boundaries of current neurosurgical modalities such as DBS and HIFU, whilst innovating novel neuromodulatory therapies, to improve prognosis and quality of life for those living with epilepsy, movement disorders, neurodegenerative disease, and psychiatric illness. In his free time, Bobby enjoys being outdoors and active, by exploring North Carolina’s abounding beauty, and playing any and all sports, his lifelong love being basketball. To further this pursuit, he is currently obtaining his pilot’s license. <br><br><br><br>" %}
