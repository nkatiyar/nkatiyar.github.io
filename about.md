# What I do

**I work as Bioinformatics Programmer in the Bioinformatics core facility at the University of California, Riverside. I have experience working on a variety of research projects in genomics, proteomics, transcriptomics and metagenomics.** My skills include programming in Perl, Python and R / Bioconductor and statistics.

# What I value

## Open Science
I am interested in contributing to the field of health and medicine and help people live a better life in the community.

## Public Health Impact
My goal is to develop methods to integrate multi-omics data (genomics, proteomics, metabolomics) to understand the health issues and find their treatments. My plan is to use machine-learning and statistical techniques to analyze the datasets.
