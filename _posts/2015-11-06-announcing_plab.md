Today, we're launching the website for P[&lambda;]ab, the Pearson Lab at Duke University. The plan is to use this blog for lab news, ongoing projects, and things we just think are cool.

**A few words about us:** As a lab, we focus on designing next-generation analysis methods for neuroscience data. Much of our work attempts to deal with large datasets, while other efforts focus on projects with clinical application. You can read more about [our vision](/about.html), [our team](/people.html), and [our research](/research.html) on the site.

**A few words about our name:** Our work brings together neuroscience, computation, and statistics, and so our logo merges several elements symbolizing these ingredients:

- three connected nerve cells, the simplest possible "neural network"
- &lambda;, the [symbol for computation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus)
- P[&middot;], the notation for the [probability of an event](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability)

Thanks for visiting. We'll be hoping to update this space regularly, so check back for project updates, new results, and more.
