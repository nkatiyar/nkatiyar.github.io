If you saw or heard about my talk at the Society for Neuroscience meeting in San Diego and are looking for the slides (including videos), they can be found at [pearsonlab.github.io/sfn-talk-2016](https://pearsonlab.github.io/sfn-talk-2016).

We are currently working on a manuscript and refining the models, but all the modeling and analysis code, as well as code for the task itself, will eventually be made public on our [GitHub](https://github.com/pearsonlab).

Finally, congratulations to [Shariq](http://shariqiqbal2810.github.io/) and Caroline, who put in all the hard work!
