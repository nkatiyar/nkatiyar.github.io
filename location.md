We're located in the [Levine Science Research Center](http://maps.duke.edu/map/?id=21#!s/key=lsrc?m/6561). LSRC is big, making it easy to find, but perhaps not easy to find us specifically.

If you're coming from West Campus (Bryan Center, Chapel, etc.), you want to enter the Hall of Science (seriously, they named it that), which is near the DIBS cube, Blue Express, and Love Auditorium.

Alternately, if you're coming from Erwin Road, Circuit, or Research Drive, we are just inside from the traffic circle:

In either case, we are the first door inside the entrance from the traffic circle (the office to the left in the photo above). The sign on the door reads Duke Institute for Brain Sciences. B107 is the lab. Enter B107A (John's office) through B107.
